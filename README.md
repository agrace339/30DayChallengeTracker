# 30DayChallengeTracker
The idea for my app comes from my family’s attempt to be more generally healthy. My sister is continually doing elimination diets or using specific facial products for a period of time in order to have clearer and more healthy skin. Tim Ferris, the author of the 4-Hour Workweek, does a similar thing by doing a particular kind of exercise for a month and measuring his weight and fitness level. Lots of people are doing a sort of self-experimentation in order to reach an end important to themselves. Many people call these things 30-Day Challenges. Sometimes the challenges are to establish or eliminate a habit, and tracking their intended effect. People, in general, are recognizing that each person responds differently to things and we must take these kinds of experiments into our own hands. The problem is tracking our progress. That’s the problem I plan to address in my new app. 
## What the final deliverables will be:
* A functional app in its first phase, in a condition submittable to Apple. 
* A well-designed/readable Github page
* A UX/UI design that has been user tested and critiqued by a UX designer

## What hard and soft skills I'll be gaining
* I always wanted to learn more about how to use Cocoa Pods which, to the best of my knowledge, are similar to modules. I also want to learn how to design UI/UX in Adobe XD.
* Learn how to improve my app through user testing
* Learn how to make a really good Github page

## What technical tools I’ll be using
* Swift, Cocoa Pods, Adobe XD

## What my week-by-week breakdown will look like throughout the month.
* Week 1: 
  1. Research what resources/tools I will need to complete the project
  2. Create preliminary UI/UX design
  3. Research how competing apps could be improved (habit/symptom trackers)
  4. Start Github project page
* Week 2:
  1. Finalize UI/UX design
  2. Add Read Me to GitHub Page
  3. Code home page and month view
* Week 3:
  1. Code day view and graphing page
  2. Allow app to send reminders
* Week 4:
  1. Bug Test/ User Test
  2. Submit to App Store
  3. Add stretch goals (add-ons), if time is available
    1. like statistical relevance and forecasting
